## Why Write This Open-Source Book

In the process of preparing for internship, I learned a lot of things from the open source community. For example, I knew the blogs of many big brothers ([Halfrost's Field | Falling Land](https://halfrost.com)), and built his own knowledge base ([Grayson's Notebook](https://notebook.grayson.top)). Therefore, I want to precipitate these knowledge and give back to the community. On the one hand, it can not only deepen their understanding of these knowledge, but also to communicate and learn with other friends on the other hand.

## The Cover of The Book

[Cover picture](https://unsplash.com/photos/qb7d1xw28co?utm_source=UNSPLASH&utm_Medium=referral&utm_Content=creditshareline) is a cute cricket, calm eyes. Only when we make all preparations can we be in our hearts and calmly.

The meaning of the cover title is "the road to computer school recruitment", which indicates that this book is mainly applicable to students who participated in the internship school recruitment back -end development related positions.

The color of the cover theme is yellow, which is the color of "harvest". I hope that this book can wish everyone a good power and succeed.

The text at the bottom of the cover is "Although the road is far away, the line is coming. Tiandao pays diligent, accumulates and hair. " "[[Most people overestimate what they can do a day, but underestimate what they can do a year](https://github.com/wolverinn/waking-up)". Only when we are down -to -earth and continue to accumulate can we calmly respond when the opportunity comes.
