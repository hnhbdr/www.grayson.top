summary: The author started preparing for the internship in March this year.
  During the preparation process, I learned a lot from the open source
  community. For example, I learned about the blogs of many big guys
  ([Halfrost's Field | Frost Land](https://halfrost.com) ), built its own
  knowledge base ([Grayson's Notebook](https://notebook.grayson.top)).
  Therefore, I want to precipitate this knowledge and give back to the
  community. On the one hand, I can not only deepen my understanding of this
  knowledge, on the other hand, I can also communicate and learn with other
  friends and make progress together.

## Why write this open source book

The author started preparing for the internship in March this year. During the preparation process, I learned a lot from the open source community. For example, I learned about the blogs of many big guys ([Halfrost's Field | Frost Land](https://halfrost.com) ), built its own knowledge base ([Grayson's Notebook](https://notebook.grayson.top)). Therefore, I want to precipitate this knowledge and give back to the community. On the one hand, I can not only deepen my understanding of this knowledge, on the other hand, I can also communicate and learn with other friends and make progress together.

## What is Cookbook

"A literal translation is a cookbook, a book that teaches you a variety of recipes and food. Students who often read [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/products/books-videos.html) technical books will know this term Very familiar. Generally hands-on, practical books will have this name."-From [LeetCode Cookbook](https://books.halfrost.com/leetcode).

## About the cover of the book

The English implication at the top of the cover is "God rewards hard work, accumulates and develops." "[Most people overestimate what they can do in a day, but underestimate what they can do in a year](https://github.com/wolverinn/Waking-Up)". Only by keeping our feet on the ground and accumulating can we calmly deal with opportunities when opportunities come.

The animal on the cover picture is a lizard walking "cautiously" on a tree, while hooking the branches behind with its tail, grabbing the branches in front with its limbs and probing its head and moving forward, only "step by step", do it well. Everything we do now can move forward more calmly.

The implied meaning of the cover title is "The Road to Computer School Recruitment", which means that this book is mainly suitable for students who participate in the back-end development-related positions of the intern school recruitment.

The color of the cover theme is green, which is the color of success. I hope this book can give you a helping hand and success.
