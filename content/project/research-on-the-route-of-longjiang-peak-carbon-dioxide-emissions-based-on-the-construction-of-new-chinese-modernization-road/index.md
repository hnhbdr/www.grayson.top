summary: "The innovation of the project: 1. The peak carbon dioxide emissions
  module analysis based on the new road construction of Chinese modernization in
  Heilongjiang is carried out; 2. Analyze the mechanism of influencing factors
  of peak carbon dioxide emissions in Heilongjiang Province; 3. Put forward the
  countermeasures and suggestions of peak carbon dioxide emissions in various
  fields in Heilongjiang Province under the background of the new road of
  Chinese modernization."

The project takes the carbon emission reduction of cities in Heilongjiang Province as the research object, and studies how to realize the path of peak carbon dioxide emissions in modules from the perspective of configuration from four aspects: industry, transportation, construction and agriculture, so as to provide a basis for planning the path of peak carbon dioxide emissions in Heilongjiang Province. Mainly responsible for the identification of influencing factors, the prediction of carbon emissions and the planning of peak carbon dioxide emissions route. Pearson correlation analysis, Lasso regression, GM and SVR models are used to predict the development trend of carbon emissions from the identification of key influencing factors. The results show that MSE and MAPE are 2.03 and 2.21, respectively, and the variance of interpretation and the square of R are 1, so the prediction effect is good. Finally, based on the forecast results, the peak carbon dioxide emissions path of Heilongjiang's economic, energy and technological development is planned.
