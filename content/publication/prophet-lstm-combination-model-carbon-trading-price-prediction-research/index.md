abstract: Driven by dual carbon goals, China's carbon trading plays an
  increasingly significant role in carbon emission reduction. The price of
  carbon trading is the core issue of carbon trading, and predicting changes in
  the price of carbon trading is of great significance to the long-term
  low-carbon development of enterprises. Based on an in-depth analysis of the
  properties of the Prophet model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural
  network, a combined Prophet-LSTM model for short-term prediction of carbon
  trading price is proposed in this paper. Prophet and LSTM prediction models
  are built separately, then a combination model is created by optimizing the
  weight coefficients for carbon trading price prediction. The data of the Hubei
  carbon trading market from 2019 to 2022 were used as an arithmetic example for
  validation. The experimental results show that the combined Prophet-LSTM
  forecasting model has more vital stability and higher accuracy than the
  standard Prophet model forecasting method, LSTM model forecasting method,
  ARIMA model forecasting method, and SARIMAX model forecasting method in carbon
  trading price time series analysis. The combined forecasting method proposed
  in this paper can effectively improve the prediction accuracy of carbon
  trading prices, thus helping enterprises assess their carbon assets and
  control the cost of carbon in production to achieve low carbon and
  high-quality development.
