abstract: The author started preparing for the internship in March this year.
  During the preparation process, I learned a lot from the open source
  community. For example, I learned about the blogs of many big guys and built
  my own knowledge base. Therefore, I want to precipitate this knowledge and
  give back to the community. On the one hand, I can not only deepen my
  understanding of this knowledge, on the other hand, I can also communicate and
  learn with other friends and make progress together.

The author started preparing for the internship in March this year. During the preparation process, I learned a lot from the open source community. For example, I learned about the blogs of many big guys ([Halfrost's Field | Frost Land](https://halfrost.com)) and built my own knowledge base ([Grayson's Notebook](https://notebook.grayson.top)). Therefore, I want to precipitate this knowledge and give back to the community. On the one hand, I can not only deepen my understanding of this knowledge, on the other hand, I can also communicate and learn with other friends and make progress together.
