abstract: In the process of preparing for internship, I learned a lot of things
  from the open source community. For example, I knew the blogs of many big
  brothers ([Halfrost's Field | Falling Land](https://halfrost.com)), and built
  his own knowledge base ([Grayson's Notebook](https://notebook.grayson.top)).
  Therefore, I want to precipitate these knowledge and give back to the
  community. On the one hand, it can not only deepen their understanding of
  these knowledge, but also to communicate and learn with other friends on the
  other hand.
